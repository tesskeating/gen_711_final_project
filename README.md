# Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) Qiime2 Analysis
## Background
In a [human microbiome study](https://microbiomejournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40168-016-0225-7), children with autism and gastrointestinal disorders were treated with fecal microbiota transplants to reduce their symptoms. For eighteen weeks, their microbiomes and severity of their symptoms were weekly monitored through fecal swab and stool samples. Using sequenced data from this study and a [Qiime2 tutorial](https://docs.qiime2.org/2024.2/tutorials/fmt/), a bioinformatic pathway analysis was performed. In this analysis, raw reads were denoised, sequences were aligned and classified, and phylogenies and diversity metrics were assessed. These bioinformatic techniques were used to generate results in the form of representative figures and visualizations.
